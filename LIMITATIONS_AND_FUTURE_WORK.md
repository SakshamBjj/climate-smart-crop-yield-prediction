# Limitations and Future Work

## Limitations

- Limited district coverage (~300 districts)
- Dependence on historical climate data
- High computational cost for deep learning models

---

## Future Enhancements

- Expand dataset to 5,000+ districts
- Incorporate real-time and daily climate streams
- Explore Transformer-based architectures
- Deploy as an API-driven decision support system
